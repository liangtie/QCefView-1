QCefView - A Qt widget integrated with CEF
===============

QCefView is a Qt widget integrated with Chrome Embedded Framework. You can use QCefView without writing any code relating to CEF code. This Qt widget is distributed in binary module and **LGPL** licensed.

Why use QCefView
----------------

There are some UI frameworks developed with CEF, such as Electron and others. But Electron is over-encapsulated with CEF, you can only develop your application with it by writing javascript code. If you need to use native code in your application while CEF is also needed, Electron is not the good choice in this situation. You can do the integration by youself totally, of cause you need to do much work about communication between web code and native code. And most time this is repetitive work.

Now you can try to use QCefView to develop your application. Just use it like any other QWidgets. QCefView widget provides several methods to do communication between native C++ code and web javascript code. You don't need to write the communicating business logical.

Build instruction:
----------

1. Download and install [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
2. Download and install Qt SDK from [Qt Downloads](https://download.qt.io/archive/qt/)
3. Download CEF binary distribution [Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) Automated Builds](http://opensource.spotify.com/cefbuilds/index.html) and extract it to ***dep*** directory, for example:
    ```
    root
    ├─dep
    │  └─cef_binary_76.1.13+gf19c584+chromium-76.0.3809.132_windows64
    ├─src
    └─test
    ```
4. Modify the [config.cmake](config.cmake) to set the required build configurations
5. Just use CMake to build the project, for example:
    ``` bat
    REM create the build folder 
    mkdir build.win && cd build.win

    REM generate and build the project
    cmake .. && cmake --build .
    ```

> Note:
When I start the reforming I use Qt 5.12.4 and CEF cef_binary_76.1.13+gf19c584+chromium-76.0.3809.132_windows64. You need to make sure the version you are choosing is compatible with the code in this repo.

6. Collect all build artifacts in ***outpu*** folder
